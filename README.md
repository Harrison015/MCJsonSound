MCJsonSound
===========
MCJsonSound is a java program I have written to help all Minecraft Mod Developers and even Resource Pack makers create those annoying sounds.json files. This program scans through a specified directory for .ogg files and writes what it has found to a specified json file. This is handy for when you need to add a lot of sound files to your json files.
